#THIS SCRIPT TAKES INPUT OF NUMBERS and SUBTRACT THEM


# Store input numbers
A = input('')
B = input('')
print('YOU JUST ENTERED THE VALUE OF A={0} and B={1}'.format(A, B))
# Subtract two numbers
diff = float(A) - float(B)

# Display the product
print('The DIFFERENCE of A and B or A-B is {2}'.format(A, B, diff))
